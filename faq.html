			<h3>자주 묻는 질문</h3>
			<ol class="list">
				<li> <p><b>What is the difference between a &#34medical need&#34 and a &#34claim&#34? </b><br>
					Christian Mutual Med-Aid (CMM) is not an insurance company.  Therefore, claims are not filed.  However, CMM is a health care sharing ministry comprised of members who choose to assist one another with the sharing of medical expenses, prayer, and encouragement.  Members submit their medical needs (itemized medical bills with CMM Needs Processing Forms) to our Needs Processing Department.  All medical needs are reviewed in accordance to the CMM membership guidelines and shared based on eligibility.</p></li>
				<li> <p><b>Are there any types of caps or maximum limits? </b><br>
					Christian Mutual Med-Aid (CMM) members may share up to $150,000 per illness during the first 12 months of membership.  Some limitations apply for pre-existing conditions and illnesses (see CMM Guidelines). </p>
					<p>After 12 consecutive months of membership, CMM members automatically qualify for additional sharing beyond $150,000 through the Burden-Sharing Program (maximum of $1 million after 10 years). </p></li>  
				<li> <p><b>Are birth defects and congenital conditions eligible for sharing?</b> <br>
					Birth defects and congenital conditions are eligible for sharing up to $25,000 provided the entire household is a Gold Plus member.</p> </li>
				<li> <p><b>What kind of medical bills are not shared (ineligible for sharing)? </b><br>
					Medical bills and/or records that expose the use of tobacco, illegal drugs, or excessive alcohol use will not be shared by CMM.  Furthermore, the member will be automatically terminated from CMM and will not be allowed to re-apply.</p>
					<p>It is important for all CMM members to uphold their statement of faith and healthy Christian lifestyle at all times.  If at any point a member fails to abide by the member qualifications, CMM will terminate the membership immediately. </p>
					<p>Eligible medical needs are based on the membership level of each individual. </p>
					<p>If a member has signs/symptoms or has received medical treatments (including prescribed medications) for any illness, conditions, or illness prior to membership, bills for such conditions are not eligible for sharing.  However, medical conditions such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and cardiovascular conditions will be eligible for sharing with limitations. </p>
					<p>Please refer to the CMM guidelines for additional information.</p></li>
				
				<li> <p><b>Is a physical exam required prior to membership?</b> <br>
					A physical exam is not required prior to membership.  All applicants need to qualify based on the following criteria:
						<ul>
							<li>Has accepted Jesus Christ as their personal Lord and Savior </li>
							<li>Confess to be a follower of Jesus Christ </li>
							<li>Live according to biblical principles </li>
							<li>Be a faithful member of the Body of Christ and attend worship service on a regular basis </li>
							<li>Abstain from alcohol and the improper use of prescription medications or over-the-counter medications, abuse of alcohol, substance abuse and dependence </li>
						</ul>
						</p>
				</li>
				<li> <p><b> What is a pre-existing condition? </b><br>
					A pre-existing condition means that the condition first occurred or showed clinical signs or symptoms (there does not need to be a diagnosis) before your membership start date (including waiting periods). </p></li>
				<li> <p><b>Is my child's congenital condition considered pre-existing?</b> <br>
					If you are aware that your child has a congenital condition before you become a CMM member, this condition will more than likely be considered pre-existing. </p></li>
				<li> <p><b>Is there a waiting period? </b><br>
					There is a 90-day waiting period after your membership start date.</p></li>
				
				<li> <p><b>What should I do in the event of medical emergency or illness during the waiting period?</b> <br>
					In the case of a medical emergency or illness during or after the waiting period, you should seek medical attention right away.  You may do the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Contact CMM at (773)777-8889 x5003 </li>
						<li>Visit any medical hospital, urgent care, or emergency room you choose </li>
						<li>Inform the medical provider that you are a &#34Self-Payer&#34 and a member of Christian Mutual Med-Aid (CMM) </li>
						<li>Inquire about any self-payer discounts/prompt pay discounts/or hospital financial aid that may be available </li>
						<li>Request all itemized medical bills to be mailed directly to your home </li>
						<li>Make copies of all documents and download the Needs Processing Forms </li>
						<li><p>Complete all (5) pages of the Needs Processing Forms and mail the original itemized medical bills to: </p>
							<ul style="list-style: none;">
								<li>Christian Mutual Med-Aid </li>
								<li>Attn: Needs Processing Department </li>
								<li>5235 N. Elston Avenue </li>
								<li>Chicago, IL 60630 </li>
							</ul>
						</li>
					</ul></p>
					<p>It is important to complete the entire Needs Processing Forms (5-page packet) to avoid a delay. Please note, medical records may be requested by CMM from your medical providers to determine eligibility of the medical bills submitted.  In such instances, there may be an additional delay in processing and sharing your qualifying medical needs. </p>
				</li>
					
				<li> <p><b>What do I do if I get into a car or motorcycle accident? </b><br>
					CMM is not a substitute for motorized vehicle insurance.  CMM is secondary to other payment resources and all primary funding resources must be exhausted before medical bills become eligible for sharing. Members may share up to $50,000 per individual or $100,000 per family after all funding resources are exhausted. CMM is not liable for injury involving non-members.</p>

					<p>CMM may require a copy of the police/accident report to determine the eligibility of sharing. Medical bills will not be considered for sharing if any CMM member(s) involved were driving under the influence or intentionally caused the accident.</p></li>

				<li> <p><b>How do I submit my needs request?</b> <br>
					Patient billing can be rather overwhelming.  Expect to receive numerous medical bills from each of your providers.  Most bills will have a payment due date.  Please do not overlook this important date.  Don&#39t worry, gather all of the original medical bills and send them to CMM with your completed Needs Processing Forms. (Be sure to make copies for yourself!)
					You can download the CMM Needs Processing Forms by clicking here.</p>
					<p>Contact CMM at (773)777-8889 x5003 for complete instructions on needs processing.</p>
					<p>It is our goal to process and reimburse needs with accuracy in a swift and timely manner.  Currently the processing time is a maximum of 60 days.  The processing time can be reduced if the member proactively secures discounts and adjustments at the time of treatment.  However, our staff is committed to working closely with your medical providers to have your needs processed with priority. </p></li>  
					
				<li> <p><b>What is my deductible? </b><br>
					As a member of a health care sharing ministry, there is no such thing as a deductible.  CMM members agree to a respective Personal Responsibility.  A Personal Responsibility is the amount designated by each membership program level (from $500 annually to $5,000 per illness).  If, however, you are able to negotiate a discount/adjustment on your medical bills, the secured reduction automatically goes towards your Personal Responsibility. </p>
					<p>If you have questions regarding your Personal Responsibility, please contact us at (773)777-8889 x5003.</p> </li>
					
				<li> <p><b>How can I contact Christian Mutual Med-Aid (CMM) about a pending needs request? </b><br>
					If you have questions regarding your pending needs request, please contact us at (773)777-8889 x5003.</p>
					<p>We are available Monday-Friday from 9:00 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. Central Standard Time.</p></li>
					<li> <p><b>I had a discount on my invoice. How does this affect my needs processing? </b><br>
					Christian Mutual Med-Aid (CMM) will apply any discounts for eligible medical bills to your Personal Responsibility. </p> </li>

				<li> <p><b>Where is my CMM membership packet? </b><br>
					Once you have successfully completed the application process including the required telephone confirmation meeting, your CMM new membership packet will be mailed.</p>
					<p>Be sure to add (773)777-8889 and info@christianmutual.org to your address book or safe sender list to ensure you receive communication from CMM.</p></li>
				<li> <p><b>How do I add a new household member? </b><br>
					New members of your household can be added to your existing member account if they qualify as a CMM member.</p>
					<p>You can call CMM at (773)777-8889 x5001 or sign in to your account online and click &#39Add New Member&#39 </p> </li>

				<li> <p><b> How much is my premium? </b><br>
					As a member of a health care sharing ministry, there is no such thing as a premium.  CMM members are committed to one another to help during times of medical need by sharing the cost of eligible medical bills.  Each month CMM members voluntarily send a gift amount designated by each membership program level.  CMM oversees and facilitates the distribution process of all eligible medical bills that are shared through the ministry. </p>
					<p>If you have questions concerning your monthly gift, please contact us at (773)777-8889 x5005.</p></li>
				
				<li> <p><b> When will the monthly gift amount be charged or deducted? </b><br>
					For members who use credit or debit cards: Your monthly gift will be charged automatically to your credit or debit card on the 1st day of each month (or the following business day if the 1st is a holiday or weekend).</p></li>
					
				<li> <p><b> What payment methods do you accept? </b><br>
					We currently accept ACH, checks, and credit cards (Visa and MasterCard). </p></li>
				
				<li> <p><b> Are there any fees associated with late monthly gifts?</b> <br>
					There no additional fees for monthly gifts received after the 1st of the month; however, any pending needs requests will be placed on hold until your account is current and up to date.</p>
					<p>Returned checks or credit card declines will incur a minimum of a $20 service fee.</p></li>
					
				<li> <p><b>How do I cancel my membership? </b><br>
					You may cancel your CMM membership at any time.  Membership cancellation is required in writing and to be faxed to (773)777-9985; e-mailed to info@christianmutual.org; or mailed to: </p>

						<li>Chicago, IL 60630 </li>
						</ul>

					<ul>
						<li>Both parents are Gold Plus members for at least 300 days prior to the birth of the baby</li>
